# AES-Encrypter
This project is a study on AES-256 and implements AES in Python and C.


## AES.py
This file contains the implementation of AES-256 in Python. It is a simple implementation and is not optimized for speed. It is meant to be used as a reference for understanding AES-256. It is heavily commented for the sake of pure understanding.

It uses the BitVector library to handle the bit manipulation. The BitVector library is not a standard library and must be installed using pip. This library was written by Professor Avinash Kak at Purdue University.
